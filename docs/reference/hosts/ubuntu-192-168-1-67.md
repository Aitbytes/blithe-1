## 3. Jellyfin Media Server Setup and System Configuration (2025-10-09)

This section details the setup of a Jellyfin media server and the configuration of the system's storage.

### 3.1. System Analysis

- **Media Capabilities:** The CPU's `asimd` (NEON) flag was identified, confirming hardware support for multimedia tasks. The device is a repurposed Android TV box, making it well-suited for efficient media playback and light transcoding.

### 3.2. Jellyfin Media Server Setup

- **Installation:** Installed Jellyfin server using the official APT repository.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Enabled hardware-accelerated transcoding by adding the `jellyfin` user to the `video` and `render` groups and configuring Jellyfin to use the **VAAPI** backend.

### 3.3. Storage Configuration for Media

- **Primary Media Drive:** The unused 14.7G internal eMMC storage (`/dev/mmcblk1`) was chosen as the optimal location for media.
- **Setup:** The drive was partitioned, formatted with `ext4`, and mounted to `/mnt/media`.
- **Configuration:** `/etc/fstab` was updated to mount the drive on boot, and ownership was given to the `jellyfin` user.
- **Performance Benchmark:**
    - A benchmark was conducted to compare the internal eMMC drive with the USB drive.
    - **Result:** The internal eMMC drive was found to be significantly faster (15.5 MB/s write, 22.3 MB/s read) than the USB drive (5.8 MB/s write, 15.9 MB/s read), confirming it as the superior choice for the media library.
